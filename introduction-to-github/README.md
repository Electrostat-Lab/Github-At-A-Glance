# Introduction to Github

## Prologue:

Github: is a version control platform designed to help organizations, open source projects, small teams and even independent developers
to carry out thier projects in a clean organized strategy and develop environments to manipulate projects releases and documentation.

Github is composed of organizations and github accounts.

Organizations and github accounts have **repositories**, **projects**, **packages**, **members** and **teams** (organizations only).

An organization is considered a github account with special credentials related to the original author.

## Github Repository:

A github repository is composed of some `branches`.

Think of a repository as a tree.

### Tree V.S. Git-Repo branches

A tree has roots, a stem, branches and leaves.

A github repo has a `remote-url`, `master` branch and other descendant branch coming out of the master branch, each repository branch holds some `commits` (which represent the changes to the files).

The main repository branch is called the `master` branch and it holds the base code for the repository.

Each branch has a some `commits`, which represent the changes to the code from the master branch and those can synonmous to the new fearues
in the world of agile development.
